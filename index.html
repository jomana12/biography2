          <p class="para" >  William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, 
            and actor born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon.
             His birthday is most commonly celebrated on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born),
             which is also believed to be the date he died in 1616.  </p>
           <br>
          <p class="para">  Shakespeare was a prolific writer during the Elizabethan and Jacobean ages of British theatre (sometimes called the English Renaissance or the Early Modern Period). 
              <a href="#plays"> <mark> Shakespeare’s plays</mark></a> are perhaps his most enduring legacy, but they are not all he wrote.

               the lives of his family members.
                John Shakespeare married Mary Arden, and together they had eight children.
                John and Mary lost two daughters as infants,
                so William became their eldest child.
                John Shakespeare worked as a glove-maker,
                but he also became an important figure in the town of Stratford by fulfilling civic positions.
                His elevated status meant that he was even more likely to have sent his children
               , including William, to the local grammar school.   </p>
